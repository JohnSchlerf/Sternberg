This program implements a version of the Sternberg
working memory test (Sternberg 1966, 1975).

The test proceeds as follows:

Subject sees a series of letters to "encode" into
  memory (by default, these are green)
The screen goes blank, and then a single "probe"
  letter appears (by default, this is white)
The subject judges whether the "probe" letter was
  a member of the set that was recently encoded
The subject presses a key to indicate thier
  response, either "yes" (by default, "f") or "no"
  (by default, "j")
The screen goes blank, and the next probe letter
  is presented, until it is time to show a new
  set to encode.
Subjects are scored by both accuracy and speed of
  response.

Many parameters controlling difficulty and duration
are adjustable in the initial GUI.

When the program is finished, data is saved to a
pair of text files, based on the "username" set
by the GUI (default "Subject"). The *.ana file
contains the trial-by-trial breakdown in 
performance, and can be used for detailed analysis.
The *.sum file contains an overview of performance,
broken down by the different set lengths.

Both text files can be opened in Excel or Matlab.
